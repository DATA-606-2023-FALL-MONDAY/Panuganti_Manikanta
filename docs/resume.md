## WORK EXPERIENCE
### SYLPH.AI | Machine Learning Engineer | Mount view, CA | Jan 2023 – May 2023
* Built a ranking recommendation model to match candidates with clients using FAISS VectorStore, cosine similarity search, OpenAI's Ada embeddings, AWS Amplify, Node.js, and React.js.
* Researched and experimented with different prompt engineering techniques, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, zero-shot, and few-shot prompting.
* Fine-tuned LLAMA2, Falcon-7BLLM models with PyTorch, Huggingface Transformers, PEFT, and QLoRa config on a custom dataset.
* Experimented with Ray Cluster to train and inference deep learning models in a distributed GPU cluster.
* Developed a user analytics dashboard for investors to see the company's users in early seed rounds.
* Built a web application frontend with Next.js and backend with AWS Amplify.
### QUOLUM | Software Engineer | Bangalore, IN | Mar 2022 – Aug 2022
* Designed and implemented a scalable and user-friendly document management platform that increased revenue by 15% and improved employee productivity by 20%.
* Incorporated data visualization features such as candlestick charts, date-time charts, and bar charts to illustrate real-time trading data and provide powerful insights to users.
* Built a serverless SaaS purchase management platform with AWS Lambda that integrated multiple applications to get usage metrics.
* Designed and developed GraphQL APIs that were highly scalable and efficient.
* Reviewed code, debugged problems, and corrected issues to ensure the quality of the software.
### THOUGHTWORKS| Software Engineer | Hyderabad, IN | Dec 2019 – Mar 2022
* Modernized GAP's legacy Profile Services system to use microservices architecture, resulting in a more scalable system.
* Built a two-way data synchronization system to sync data between relational and NoSQL databases, reducing sync time by 50%.
* Researched and implemented different schema strategies for an event-driven system (Kafka), ensuring data consistency.
* Actively participated in beta testing and fixed numerous on-call issues, demonstrating strong problem-solving and debugging skills.
* Containerized multiple applications and deployed them with Docker and Kubernetes, streamlining the deployment process and increasing reliability.
* Developed a proxy system for seamless transition from legacy APIs to latest, improving user experience and reducing downtime.
* Learned and used XP practices such as TDD, unit testing, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), design patterns, software design principles, architecture, scrums, and feedback, demonstrating a commitment to quality and continuous improvement.
* Researched and built a dashboard to analyze corrupted data, improving the ability to identify and resolve data issues.
