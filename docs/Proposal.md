## 2. Background

Sleep is undeniably crucial for both physical and mental well-being. It plays a fundamental role in maintaining overall health, impacting various facets of human life, including cognitive function, mood regulation, behavior, and emotional well-being. However, despite its paramount importance, conducting comprehensive and precise sleep research has been a persistent challenge. Polysomnography (PSG) stands as the gold standard for sleep measurement, providing highly accurate data. However, PSG is not without its drawbacks, as it is an expensive and time-consuming method, making it impractical for large-scale studies and routine monitoring.In contrast, wrist-worn accelerometers present a more accessible and cost-effective means of measuring sleep patterns. Nevertheless, the analysis of accelerometer data poses its own set of challenges, including the need for robust and accurate algorithms to extract meaningful sleep-related information.

The goal of this project is to develop a model to detect sleep onset and wake using wrist-worn accelerometer data. This will enable researchers to conduct more reliable, larger-scale sleep studies across a range of populations and contexts.


## 3. Data 
The data for this project was provided by the [Healthy Brain Network] (https://healthybrainnetwork.org/). The data consists of wrist-worn accelerometer data which includes the following features:
- Data sources: https://healthybrainnetwork.org/, https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states/data
- Data size : 220 MB
- Data shape: 13165560 rows, 6 cols
- Each row is a continuous series recording of accelerometer data for a single subject spanning many days.
- Data dictionary
  - Columns name
  - Data type
  - Defition
  - Potential values (for categorical valuables, what are the categories?)
- Target Label: Awake
- features/predictors: anglez, enmo
